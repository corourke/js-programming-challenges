### Introduction to Blockchain Challenges

Blockchain technology has been one of the most transformative forces in recent years. Whether you're interested in cryptocurrencies, supply chain management, or distributed data storage,understanding the basic elements of a blockchain is invaluable.

In this series of challenges, we will walk you through the foundational elements of a blockchain:

1. **Introduction to Hashing with `crypto-js`**: The first challenge introduces you to the concept of cryptographic hashing, a fundamental building block in the world of blockchain. Hashing functions enable us to maintain data integrity and are a cornerstone in the construction of blockchains.
  
2. **Creating a Basic Block Structure**: Building upon your knowledge of hashing, the second challenge directs you toward creating a single block. You'll learn how blocks contain data and how they are chained together to ensure integrity.

3. **Creating and Validating a Simple Blockchain**: The third challenge moves from individual blocks to a chain of blocksâ€”a simple blockchain. Here, you'll learn about the mechanics of adding blocks to a chain and validating the integrity of the entire blockchain.

The primary objective of these challenges is to give you some JavaScript coding practice, while introducing you to blockchain concepts.
