### Introduction to Blockchain Challenges

> This is an in-progress project to provide beginning JavaScript programmers with blockchain oriented programming challenges. I'm still working out the structure. 

Blockchain technology has been one of the most transformative forces in recent years. Whether you're interested in cryptocurrencies, supply chain management, or distributed data storage,understanding the basic elements of a blockchain is invaluable.

In this series of challenges, we will walk you through the foundational elements of a blockchain:

1. **Introduction to Hashing with `crypto-js`**: The first challenge introduces you to the concept of cryptographic hashing, a fundamental building  block  in the world of blockchain. Hashing functions enable us to maintain data integrity and are a cornerstone in the construction of blockchains.
  
2. **Creating a Basic Block Structure**: Building upon your knowledge of hashing, the second challenge directs you toward creating a single block. You'll learn how blocks contain data and how they are chained together to ensure integrity.

3. **Creating and Validating a Simple Blockchain**: The third challenge moves from individual blocks to a chain of blocksâ€”a simple blockchain. Here, you'll learn about the mechanics of adding blocks to a chain and validating the integrity of the entire blockchain.

The primary objective of these challenges is to give you some JavaScript coding practice, while introducing you to blockchain concepts. 

#### Prerequisites

I assume that you have been through a basic course on JavaScript fundamentals. Such as: 
- [Codecademy Learn Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
    - implement JavaScript data types, built-in methods, and variables
    - use conditionals to control the flow of a program in JavaScript
    - construct functions and pass data through them
    - identify global and block-level scopes in JavaScript
    - use arrays to store lists of data
    - use loops to execute blocks of code multiple times
    - use iterator methods to simplify the process of looping over arrays
    - use JavaScript ES6 object syntax to model real-world items
- [Codecademy Learn Node.js](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-node-js
    - What Node.js is and how it can be used for back-end programming
    - How to use built-in Node.js modules to create event-driven web applications
    - How to set up Node.js locally
    - How to implement modules in Node.js
    - How to create an HTTP server using the built-in http module

Are you ready to jump in? Let's begin with the first challenge!
