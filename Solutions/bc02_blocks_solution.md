Here's a solution document for Challenge 2, which discusses creating a basic block structure.

### Challenge 2 Solution

#### Step 1: Setup

If you've completed Challenge 1, you already have a Node.js project set up with Jest for testing. If not, you can follow the same steps to set up your environment:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev jest
```

#### Step 2: Create a Basic Block Structure

Create a new file named `block.js`. In this file, create a JavaScript class named `Block` that takes an `index`, `timestamp`, `data`, and `previousHash` as arguments and initializes them using a constructor. Import the `crypto-js` library at the top.

For `calculateHash`, you can import the hashing function (`generateHash`) you created in the previous challenge.

```javascript
const generateHash = require('./hashing')

class Block {
  constructor({ index, timestamp, data, previousHash }) {
    ;(this.index = index),
      (this.timestamp = timestamp),
      (this.data = data),
      (this.previousHash = previousHash),
      (this.hash = this.calculateHash())
  }

  calculateHash() {
    return generateHash(
      this.index +
        this.timestamp +
        (typeof this.data == 'string' ? this.data : JSON.stringify(this.data)) + // if !type string
        this.previousHash
    )
  }
}

module.exports = Block
```

#### Step 3: Writing Jest Tests

Create a new file named `block.test.js`. In this file, write Jest tests to validate the `Block` class and its methods.

Here are some Jest test suggestions:

1. Test if the `Block` constructor sets the `index`, `timestamp`, `data`, and `previousHash` fields correctly.
2. Validate that the `calculateHash` method generates a hash that includes the `index`, `timestamp`, `data`, and `previousHash`.

A Jest test might look something like this:

```javascript
const Block = require('./block');
const generateHash = require('./hashing');

describe('Block', () => {
  it('initializes with the correct data', () => {
    const timestamp = Date.now()
    const block = new Block(0, timestamp, 'This is the Genesis Block!', '0');
    expect(block.index).toEqual(0);
    expect(block.timestamp).toEqual(timestamp);
    expect(block.data).toEqual('This is the Genesis Block!');
    expect(block.previousHash).toEqual('0');
  });

  it('calculates the hash based on input data', () => {
    const block = new Block(0, Date.now(), 'Initial data', '0');
    const calculatedHash = generateHash(`${block.index}${block.timestamp}${block.data}${block.previousHash}`);
    expect(block.calculateHash()).toEqual(calculatedHash);
  });
});
```

Run your Jest tests by executing:

```bash
npm test
```

This will output the results of your tests, indicating if they have passed or failed. With this, you have successfully created a basic block structure and confirmed its functionality through tests. This sets the stage for creating a complete blockchain in the next challenge.
