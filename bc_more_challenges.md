### Aspirational List of Challenges

The idea is to have an end-to-end set of blockchain related challenges that offer JavaScript beginners a way to cement their learnings with a layered understanding of blockchain technology, web3, and decentralized networks.

- **Challenge 1: Introduction to Hashing with `crypto-js`**: The first challenge introduces you to the concept of cryptographic hashing, a fundamental building block in the world of blockchain. Hashing functions enable us to maintain data integrity and are a cornerstone in the construction of blockchains.
  
- **Challenge 2: Creating a Basic Block Structure**: Building upon your knowledge of hashing, the second challenge directs you toward creating a single block. You'll learn how blocks contain data and how they are chained together to ensure integrity.

- **Challenge 3: Creating and Validating a Simple Blockchain**: The third challenge moves from individual blocks to a chain of blocksâ€”a simple blockchain. Here, you'll learn about the mechanics of adding blocks to a chain and validating the integrity of the entire blockchain.

- **Challenge 4: Implementing Blockchain Persistence**
    - Focus on storing the blockchain data in a persistent storage, like a simple JSON file or a local database.
    - Learn about reading and writing to files or databases in Node.js.

- **Challenge 5: Creating a Basic Node.js Server for the Blockchain**
    - Introduce the notion of a server in server-client architecture.
    - Create a server that reads the blockchain's state on startup and writes it out upon exiting.

- **Challenge 6: Implementing a RESTful API for the Blockchain**
    - Implement a RESTful API with essential blockchain operations.
    - Use Postman to test the API endpoints.

- **Challenge 9: Developing a Command-Line Interface (CLI) Client**
    - Create a CLI application for user interaction with the blockchain via commands.
    - The client communicates with the API to perform actions like viewing the blockchain, adding blocks, and validating the blockchain.

- **Challenge 7: Peer-to-Peer Communication for Blockchain Nodes**
    - Extend the networking concepts to implement a rudimentary peer-to-peer network.
    - Enable nodes to share the latest state of their blockchain with their peers.

- **Challenge 8: Implementing Collision Handling**
    - Develop an algorithm to decide which block to add to the blockchain in case of simultaneous block additions.

- **Challenge 10: Introducing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Data Signing**
    - Start introducing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Students will learn the basics of asymmetric cryptography, specifically how to generate a key pair, and how to use these keys to sign the data that goes into a block.

- **Challenge 11: Implementing Consensus Algorithms**
    - Introduce the concept of consensus algorithms like Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake and have the students implement a basic version.

* **Challenge 12: Transaction Management**
    * Teach how to create, validate, and manage transactions in a blockchain. Implement a transaction pool and include valid transactions in new blocks.

- **Challenge 13: Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (DApps)**
    - Introduce the concept of smart contracts and how they form the basis of decentralized applications.
    - Understand what smart contracts are.
    - Create a basic smart contract.
    - Learn how smart contracts can interact with a blockchain.

- **Challenge 14: Tokenization and Digital Assets**
    - Discuss the concept of tokens and digital assets, and demonstrate how to create a basic token on your blockchain.
    - Understand the importance and utility of tokens and digital assets.

- **Challenge 15: Basic Privacy Features**
    - Implement basic privacy features like zero-knowledge proofs or private transactions.
    - Learn about the privacy challenges in public blockchains.
    - Implement a simple privacy feature like confidential transactions.
